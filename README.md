# Planets
#
#  Program that uses a mix of files, functions, and calulations \n
#  to gather information on planets, stars, habitable planets, \n
#  distance of the planets/stars
#
#  The first part of the progam is where the functions are made
#
#  The first funtion opens a file, the second is a float function, \n
#  the third retrieves the density, the fourth is for the temperature, \n
#  and the fifth is for the distance
#
#  In the main function, variables are made and most of the code is run \n
#  through a for loop.
#
#  Each if statement in ther for loop runs through a given file to \n
#  obtain the necessary information needed for the calculation
#
# The print statements at the end display the data
